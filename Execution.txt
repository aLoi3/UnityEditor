* Calculate score in the AI script (must be return type)
* Get all score into ScriptData script 
* Choose the highest one
* Execute that score's behaviour (must be void)

Notes:
- Always must be a cunstructor of the class name (can also be empty)
- Score evaluation's function must called the same in all scripts
- Executed behaviour's function name must also be the same in all scripts


if getting component doesn't work in behaviour script, add it in the scriptData and send it to the constructor

behaviourMethod was invoking the last script's method (if the one that should be executed was first, it would give an error)

Currently works only with one script -> need to make it function with multiple scripts attached to the list

Both ConstructionInfo methods work (in the Start)
